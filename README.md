# Flexiformal Relocalization

In this repository, we develop a flexiformal relocalization system.
It is based on our previous prototypes:

1. [Prototype 1](https://gitos.rrze.fau.de/voll-ki/fau/system/relocalization/): Template-based relocalization of sTeX content.
2. [Prototype 2](https://github.com/10S1/definitionexpansion/tree/main/sTeX): GF RGL-based definition expansion of sTeX content.
3. [Prototype 3](https://github.com/10S1/definitionexpansion/tree/main/sHTML): GF RGL-based definition expansion of FTML content (formerly called sHTML).
4. [Prototype 4](https://github.com/10S1/definitionexpansion/tree/main/cnltransforms): Definition expansion and recontextualization of FTML content using GF-based CNL.
