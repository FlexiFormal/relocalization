* Citations in beginning of paragraph. This typically happens in the preliminaries, when an author does something like "\begin{defn}\label{Csemi} $(${\rm cf.} \cite[Proposition 1]{R}$)$" (from https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00244)

* Remove non-English papers (on demand - systematic recognation with nltk was not accurate enough)


* in sentence preprocessing: Append "." if sentence ends with equation

* PLANNED: For enumerations: put each item in a separate sentence. It's not clear if this is the correct design decision, but otherwise we can get giant sentence with lots of nested sentences (think "we define: 1. ... 2. ... etc.")
