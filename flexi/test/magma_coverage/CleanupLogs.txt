* Citations in beginning of paragraph. This typically happens in the preliminaries, when an author does something like "\begin{defn}\label{Csemi} $(${\rm cf.} \cite[Proposition 1]{R}$)$" (from https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00244)

* Remove non-English papers (on demand - systematic recognation with nltk was not accurate enough)

* If one paragraph contains lots of paragraphs (\begin{definition}...\begin{proposition}...\end{proposition}...\end{definition}). Only the initial paragraph is kept. Proofs (if included in theorems) are also removed.


* in sentence preprocessing: Append "." if sentence ends with equation

* PLANNED: For enumerations: put each item in a separate sentence. It's not clear if this is the correct design decision, but otherwise we can get giant sentence with lots of nested sentences (think "we define: 1. ... 2. ... etc.")


* Itemizes/Enumerations:
    - Sentences containing enum are a list, containing the sequence fragments as string and a list of strings in the position of the enum.
        example: "If x is (a) even, (b) odd, or (c) prime, then ..." becomes
        ["If x is ", ["(a) even", "(b) odd", "(c) prime"], ", then ..."]
    - labels are kept along with marks (e.g. in "(c) (isofibrations) blah...")
    - if an entry in an enum contains multiple sentences, they are put in sequence into the list.

* footnotes: largely removed (in the beginning, two or so were inlined)
